# E-Commerce-System
E-Commerce System Simulator program. 
The system keeps track of all its products, registered customers, current orders, and shipped orders.

CLASSES:

	1. ECommerceSystem: this class contains the bulk of the logic for the system. 
	It maintains an TreeMap<String, Product> where key is the Product Id of Product objects, 
	Customer objects, ProductOrder objects and ProductOrder objects that have been shipped. 
	
	2. ECommerceUserInterface: this class has the main() method and is the user interaction part. 
	In a while loop, a scanner reads a line of input from the user. 
	The input lines contain words (Strings). The first word is the action (e.g. custs, prods). 

	3. Customer: this class models a registered Ecommerce customer. 
	It contains the customer name, and ID (a string generated by the system) and a shipping address.

	4. Product: this class contains several instance variables to model a product: 
	Product ID, name, type, price and product options. 

	5. ProductOrder: this class stores the order of a product by a customer. 
	It contains an orderNumber (a string generated by the system), a reference to the product object ordered, 
	and a reference to the customer object. 
	It also stores any product options associated with this product that were entered by the user. 
	
	6. Book: this class is a subclass of Product. 
	It also stores additional information (author, title). 
	A book maybe in one of 3 formats: “Paperback”, “Hardcover”, “EBook”. It also has additional variables to 
	store the number of hardcover books in stock for this book, the number of paperbacks, and has an essentially 
	infinite number of EBook copies. 	
	
	7. Shoes: this class is a subclass of Product with some specific options. 
	The user should be able to buy a pair of shoes that have sizes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and possible colors black or brown.
