The system keeps track of all its products, registered customers, current orders, and shipped orders.

There is a list of actions provided below. In the command prompt, type in the Action Name. Letter case does not matter. Fill in any information (eg: ID, Category) if prompted to.

## Credit
This is an assignment I did while taking CPS209 at Toronto Metropolitan University. The skeleton code was provided and our task was to add classes and code so that the program is executable. That includes actions, File I/O, and exception handling.
